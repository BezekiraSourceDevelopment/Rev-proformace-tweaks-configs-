  #//Tables are groups of rewards which work as a weighted system. Below are a few examples, but they are very simple and not too elaborate.
  #//   Much like the rewards, the Tables are re-usable. As a matter of fact the Tables are needed by all "Random" rewards areas.
  #//   They are pretty basic to use, Give it an id (no two id's should be the same) and then make a list with alternating weights and reward ids
  #//   The weights are pretty simple to use, the higher number a reward has the likelier it is to be chosen. in the "TableCommon" below 'money1' has
  #//   25/95 chances to be chosen.

  #//           =======================

  //# These are the Rewards. In essence each reward is a set of commands with a name that can be re-used in different tables.
  //#   Each Reward Requires an id "which is the descriptor / identifier such as tomahawk: in the tomahawk reward. Make sure to avoid spaces.
  //#   In addition each reward requires a name key, and a reward key
  //#   The value for name is just a text String (This can be used to Call it out in the broadcast built in)
  //#   The value for the rewards string is a list of strings. Each String should be a full command and can include the standard variables
  //#   Each new command string needs a comma before it. If your command requires quotations make sure to add escape characters
  //#     i.e ----"hello how "are" you"---- is not valid the string should be escaped as follows
  //#         ----"hello how \"are\" you---- The backslash allows the " to be escaped to be ignored by the parser
  //#
  //# Every single Reward should have it's id be unique, i.e there should not be more than one tomahawk ect... The name of the items can
  //# be duplicated though, so a tomahawk1, and a tomahawk2, can have "Steel Tomahawk" as the name"
